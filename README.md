# JacobLee_MUSI4620_FinalComp
 
The objective of this project is to visualize multiple polymetric elements interacting with one another and melded together with a simple dnb drum beat. 
The visualization of the spheres represents each polymetric element, and they random change location each time they are played on the x, y, and z axes.
The spheres are generated with random colors.
The background plane is animated through the drums, created with a combination of voronoi and gradient noise. The kick drum animates the angle offset of 
the voronoi and the snare animates the cell density of the voronoi. The hihats animate the scale of the gradient noise. 
The camera is animated through the timeline and has no correlation to any musical elements.
The light is also animated through the timeline and also has no correlation to any musical elements.

To play this project, one must individually activate each sound. Instead of all sounds being defaulted to on, the gradual build up of noise allows the 
user to understand which sphere correlates to which polymeter. The user input element of the project also allows for greater understanding of each 
element of sound as the user must interact with the project for each sound to play.

The checkboxes turn each individual noise on and off, circled in red on the screenshot above, and are found in the "Sound" object. It is recommended to play with turning on and off the polymeter 
objects before turning on the drum and bass objects for maximum effect.
